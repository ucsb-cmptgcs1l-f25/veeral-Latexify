# veeral-Latexify

---

## Project Overview

**Type:** Terminal Run (eventually android app)

**Tech Stack:** Python, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, Flask

---

### About the Project

This project aims to build an application that converts images of handwritten or printed mathematical formulas into LaTeX code automatically. Users can upload an image containing math expressions, and the app will process it using a deep learning model trained for OCR on mathematical notations. The goal is to simplify and speed up the creation of LaTeX documents by reducing manual transcription errors and saving time for researchers, students, and educators.

### User Roles and Capabilities

* **General Users**: Upload images of math formulas, receive LaTeX output, and download or copy the result for their use.
* **Advanced Users**: Provide feedback on OCR accuracy, suggest corrections, and save frequently used formulas.
* **Admins** (eventually): Manage user accounts, monitor system performance, update the underlying model, and moderate user contributions or corrections.

---

### Tech Stack

* **Python**: Core programming language chosen for its rich ecosystem of ML and data processing libraries.
* **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework used to load and run the VisionEncoderDecoderModel for OCR.
* **Hugging Face Transformers**: Provides pretrained models and tokenizers that facilitate state-of-the-art performance on image-to-text tasks.
* **Flask/FastAPI** (if applicable): Web framework to serve the app and handle HTTP requests.
* **Pillow**: For image processing and loading.

*Reasons for tech choices:* Python and PyTorch were selected due to their flexibility and strong support for cutting-edge computer vision models. Hugging Faceâ€™s transformers library offers a convenient interface for state-of-the-art models and rapid experimentation. Flask or FastAPI provides lightweight but powerful APIs for serving the model to users.

### Visuals / Current Experience

*If you have screenshots or GIFs, include them here, or at least describe what the user currently sees:*

* Users visit a clean interface to upload images.
* The app processes the image and returns LaTeX code in a text box.
* Copy button and download options are available.
* Real-time feedback or error messages appear if the image is invalid or the model struggles.
